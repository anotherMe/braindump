# ISO/OSI vs TCP/IP


## Router vs switch

In respect to the ISO/OSI layers:

| Router                                                        | Switch                                          |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| works at network layer                                        | works at data link layer                        |
| make use of IP address                                        | make use of MAC address                         |
| routes data between different subnets ( example: WAN to LAN ) | connects devices on the same subnet (using NAT) |
| usually has built-in switch functionality                     |                                                 |
| DHCP service                                                  |                                                 |
| NAT                                                           |                                                 |
| Firewall                                                      |                                                 |
